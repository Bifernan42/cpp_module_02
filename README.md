# Third C++ Assignment  

## Concepts:  [Orthodox Canonical Form, Fixed-Point Arithmetic, Operator Overloading, Binary Space Partitioning]  

In this third assignment, we had to:  
- Implement a **Fixed-Point Number** class in **Orthodox Canonical Form**  
- Overload **comparison, arithmetic, and increment/decrement operators**  
- Convert between **integer, floating-point, and fixed-point representations**  
- Use **static member functions** to compare fixed-point numbers  
- Apply **binary space partitioning (BSP)** to determine if a point is inside a triangle  

This assignment reinforced **memory management, operator overloading, and geometric algorithms** in C++.
